Instructions

Your attorneys will have to follow your instructions exactly.
For examples of instructions, see the Guide, part A7.

Be careful — if you give instructions that are not legally
correct they would have to be removed before your LPA could
be registered.

If you want to give instructions, you may want to take
legal advice.

Instructions — use words like ‘must’ and ‘have to’

a need more space — use Continuation sheet 2.
